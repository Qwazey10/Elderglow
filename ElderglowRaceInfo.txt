Elderglow Race Information

RaceID is how we determine which display race the character will have. Its stored in the Playerstate which is 
Source/Elderglow/Character/ElderglowPlayerstate.h 

When the player logs in, the dedicated server will connect to the Redis Database  which will store character information. 

RaceIDs:

0 = Undefined, this will mean that there was an error retrieving the RaceID from the server. 

Human = 1;

Woodelf = 2;

Ogre = 3;

ElderglowCharacter.cpp is where we get the RaceID and setup which DataAsset we will use, Then set the values of the
corresponding meshes, then bind them to the master pose component.
